    # This is the name of your project. The first time you publish this
    # package, this name will be registered for you. It will determine how
    # users can install this project, e.g.:
    #
    # $ pip install sampleproject
    #
    # And where it will live on PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/sampleproject/
    #
    # There are some restrictions on what makes a valid project name
    # specification here:
    # https://packaging.python.org/specifications/core-metadata/#name
    name='casite',  # Required

    # Versions should comply with PEP 440:
    # https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/
    #
    # For a discussion on single-sourcing the version across setup.py and the
    # project code, see
    # https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/single_source_version.html
    version='2.0.0',  # Required

    # This is a one-line description or tagline of what your project does. This
    # corresponds to the "Summary" metadata field:
    # https://packaging.python.org/specifications/core-metadata/#summary
    description='CA Site library',  # Optional

    # This is an optional longer description of your project that represents
    # the body of text which users will see when they visit PyPI.
    #
    # Often, this is the same as your README, so you can just read it in from
    # that file directly (as we have already done above)
    #

    # You can just specify package directories manually here if your project is
    # simple. Or you can use find_packages().
    #
    # Alternatively, if you just want to distribute a single Python file, use
    # the `py_modules` argument instead as follows, which will expect a file
    # called `my_module.py` to exist:
    #
    #   py_modules=["my_module"],
    #
    packages=find_packages(),  # Required

    # Specify which Python versions you support. In contrast to the
    # 'Programming Language' classifiers above, 'pip install' will check this
    # and refuse to install the project if the version does not match. See
    # https://packaging.python.org/guides/distributing-packages-using-setuptools/#python-requires
    python_requires='>=2.6, <4',

    # # This field lists other packages that your project depends on to run.
    # # Any package you put here will be installed by pip when your project is
    # # installed, so they must be valid existing projects.
    # #
    # # For an analysis of "install_requires" vs pip's requirements files see:
    # # https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/requirements.html
    # install_requires=['peppercorn'],  # Optional

    # # List additional groups of dependencies here (e.g. development
    # # dependencies). Users will be able to install these using the "extras"
    # # syntax, for example:
    # #
    # #   $ pip install sampleproject[dev]
    # #
    # # Similar to `install_requires` above, these must be valid existing
    # # projects.
    # extras_require={  # Optional
    #     'dev': ['check-manifest'],
    #     'test': ['coverage'],
    # },

    # # If there are data files included in your packages that need to be
    # # installed, specify them here.
    # package_data={  # Optional
    #     'sample': ['package_data.dat'],
    # },

    # # Although 'package_data' is the preferred approach, in some case you may
    # # need to place data files outside of your packages. See:
    # # http://docs.python.org/distutils/setupscript.html#installing-additional-files
    # #
    # # In this case, 'data_file' will be installed into '<sys.prefix>/my_data'
    # data_files=[('my_data', ['data/data_file'])],  # Optional

    # # To provide executable scripts, use entry points in preference to the
    # # "scripts" keyword. Entry points provide cross-platform support and allow
    # # `pip` to create the appropriate form of executable for the target
    # # platform.
    # #
    # # For example, the following would provide a command called `sample` which
    # # executes the function `main` from this package when invoked:
    # entry_points={  # Optional
    #     'console_scripts': [
    #         'sample=sample:main',
    #     ],
    # },

    # # List additional URLs that are relevant to your project as a dict.
    # #
    # # This field corresponds to the "Project-URL" metadata fields:
    # # https://packaging.python.org/specifications/core-metadata/#project-url-multiple-use
    # #
    # # Examples listed include a pattern for specifying where the package tracks
    # # issues, where the source is hosted, where to say thanks to the package
    # # maintainers, and where to support the project financially. The key is
    # # what's used to render the link text on PyPI.
    # project_urls={  # Optional
    #     'Bug Reports': 'https://github.com/pypa/sampleproject/issues',
